# Calorie Counter

This is a simple web-based Calorie Counter application that helps users track their daily caloric intake and expenditure. Users can log their meals and exercises, and the app calculates whether they are in a calorie surplus or deficit based on their daily calorie budget.

## Features

- **Add Entries:** Users can add entries for different meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks) and exercises.
- **Calorie Calculation:** The app calculates the total calories consumed, calories burned, and compares them against the user's calorie budget.
- **Clear Form:** Users can clear all inputs to start fresh.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** The app provides instant feedback on whether the user is in a calorie surplus or deficit.

## Usage

1. **Set Your Calorie Budget:** Enter your daily calorie budget in the input field provided.
2. **Log Your Meals and Exercises:** Select a category (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, exercise) and add entries with names and calorie amounts.
3. **Calculate:** Click the "Calculate" button to see your calorie summary.
4. **Clear the Form:** Use the "Clear" button to reset the form and start over.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structure of the application.
- **CSS:** Basic styling for layout and design.
- **JavaScript:** Core logic for calorie calculation and dynamic form handling.
